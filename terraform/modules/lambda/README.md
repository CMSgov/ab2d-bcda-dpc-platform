# Terraform module for lambda resources

This is a generic module for creating lambda resources in CMS Cloud. Use it in terraform services where a lambda is needed.

Note that a dummy lambda is included to allow for initial creation of the lambda. It is meant to be replaced once the lambda has been created.
